wharf rats 2022 project source code

branches:  
backend - the backend code, meant to run on the raspberry pi  
frontend - the frontend code, can be ran on the pi but not really.

please don't ever try to replicate any of this code. i had just learned vue and the entirety of the "backend" was written in nano on a 3.5 inch touchscreen.
